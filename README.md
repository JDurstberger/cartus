A structured logging abstraction with multiple backends, currently including:
* A test implementation for collecting logs in memory and asserting against 
  them.
* A cambium implementation for logging out via SLF4J and logback.

Heavily inspired by [JUXT's blog on logging](https://juxt.pro/blog/logging).
